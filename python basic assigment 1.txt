1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
&#39;hello&#39;
-87.8
C
6

Ans- In the given expressions values are &#39;hello&#39, -87.8 ,6 and expressions are *,-,+,/


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans-A string is a sequence of characters, while a variable is a named location in memory that can hold a value. A string can be stored in a variable, but a variable is not a string.



3. Describe three different data types.
Ans-Integer: An integer is a whole number, positive or negative. Integers can be represented in binary, decimal, octal, or hexadecimal form.
Float: A float is a real number, meaning it can have a decimal point. Floats can be represented in decimal form or scientific notation.
String: A string is a sequence of characters. Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Ans-An expression in Python is a combination of values and operators that evaluates to a single value. Expressions are made up of:

Operands: These are the values that are operated on by the operators. Operands can be numbers, strings, Boolean values, or variables.
Operators: These are symbols that perform operations on the operands. Operators can be arithmetic operators, logical operators, or comparison operators.
Parentheses: Parentheses can be used to group expressions together. This is useful for controlling the order of operations.


5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
the expression spam = 10 evaluates to the value 10. The statement spam = 10 does not evaluate to a value, but it assigns the value 10 to the variable spam.


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans-
The variable bacon will still contain 22 after running the code. The bacon + 1 expression does not actually change the value of the bacon variable. It simply evaluates to the value 23, but does not assign that value to bacon.


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
&#39;spam&#39; + &#39;spamspam&#39;
&#39;spam&#39; * 3
Ans- 
The value of the first term, 'spam' + 'spamspam', should be 'spamspamspam'. This is because the + operator in Python concatenates strings. So, when you concatenate the strings 'spam' and 'spamspam', you get the string 'spamspamspam'.

The value of the second term, 'spam' * 3, should be 'spamspamspam'. This is because the * operator in Python repeats a string a certain number of times. So, when you repeat the string 'spam' 3 times, you get the string 'spamspamspam'.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

Python
'spam' + 'spamspam'
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code first evaluates the expression 'spamspam'. The value of this expression is the string 'spamspam'. Then, the code evaluates the expression 'spam' + 'spamspam'. The value of this expression is the concatenation of the strings 'spam' and 'spamspam', which is 'spamspamspam'.




8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans-In Python, a variable name can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores, but it cannot start with a number. This is why the variable name eggs is valid, while the variable name 100 is invalid.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans-int(): This function takes a value and returns the integer version of that value. For example, the expression int("123") would return the integer 123.
float(): This function takes a value and returns the floating-point version of that value. For example, the expression float("12.3") would return the floating-point number 12.3.
str(): This function takes a value and returns the string version of that value. For example, the expression str(123) would return the string "123".


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
&#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;

Ans-
The expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated with other strings using the + operator. To fix the error, you need to convert the integer 99 to a string. You can do this using the str() function. For example, the following code would fix the error:
